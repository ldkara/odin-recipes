Here's how to make them:

    <p><h2><em>Instructions</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep skillet, pour fresh milk. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Let it simmer for 15 minutes while stirring regularly.  </li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Stir the mixture gently and constantly with a wooden spoon scraping the bottom to prevent lumps from forming and burning.        </li>
        <li>Continue to cook until mixture is greatly reduced and forms a thick paste. Turn off the heat and add the butter and mix. (Remove skillet from stove)        </li>
        <li>Add the powdered milk to the mixture and mix until a sticky dough forms. Transfer milk dough to a plate or bowl and let it cool down completely.        </li>
        <li>Roll the milk dough into a cylinder and cut into four equal portions. Take a portion and roll it into a thinner log. Then cut the log into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece to about 1 ½-inch long.       </li>
        <li>Roll each piece in caster sugar coating it completely.  </li>
        <li>Wrap a small white paper around a piece of pastillas placing it in the middle, with both ends open. Then wrap both in a tissue paper. Push the excess tissue paper at the ends inwards to close the holes.

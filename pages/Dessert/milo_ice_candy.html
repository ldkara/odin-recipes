    <p>There was a time in my childhood where very few blocks of houses down the street would be selling some sort of flavored ice candy, which is just essentially frozen flavored milk ice pops. My most favority is the Milo Ice Candy that my cousin made us to last for a month!!! Here's one way to make them:</p>

        </li>
        <li>Continue to cook on medium heat for 3-5 minutes while continuously whisking to avoid lumps.

    <h1><em>Mouth watering Sinigang for you, champ!</em></h1>
    <img src="https://yummykitchentv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sinigang.jpg" alt="Picture of Sinigang from google...looks so good" width="350"> Every Filipino, and I mean EVERY Filipino, should have some degree of love for Sinigang. Some people are not really fond of them, such as my brother, but that only means they're weird. Sinigang is THE BEST hands down.... the best Filipino dish ever created. I heard that other countries have some kind of rendition on it such as Indonesia, which makes sense since we're kind of near each other, but for me this definitely represents the country. Filipinos love soupy dishes during rainy or stormy weather, or even just during any morning. This sour and umami-filled flavor-bomb of a soup dish will make you want to be Filipino. 

    <P>There are different recipes for this, usually based on what meat you're using. There's the <em>malapot</em> kind of soup wherein the root crop <em>gabi</em> is used to thicken up the soup with its starchy goodness, and there's the more watery soup which I love; here's how the watery kind is made for the fish <em>Bangus</em></p>
    <p><h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large milkfish (sliced into serving pieces)</li>

        <li>Once all ingredients are cooked, the dish is ready. Turn the heat off.

<h1><em>How to cook saucy and moist ADOBO</em></h1>    
<img src=../../images/adobo.jpg alt="Picture of the best Adobo Doktora Kara created thus far. Created on September 24, 2024 GMT+8" width="150"> What better way to start your week than to stock up on your juicy, saucy, moist adobo!! Every Filipino family has their very own recipe on making their adobo. I wasn't really taught by my family on how to make adobo, it was more so from my own research how to make my own adobo - something that suits my taste of being tangy, salty, and garlicy! And I love my Adobo to be moist and SAUCY! Here's how I do it:
<p><h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2></p>
<ul>
    <li> 1/2 kilo chicken thigh (any chicken part is ok, chicken thigh is always moist!)</li>
    <li>1 head of garlic</li>
    <li>1 head of onion</li>
    <li>50 mL of vinegar of choice (apple cider or cane vinegar is great)</li>
    <li>100 mL of soy sauce (can mix 50 mL dark soy sauce and 50 mL light soy sauce)</li>
    <li> 1-2 tbsp brown sugar (white sugar is ok)</li>
    <li>1 tspn salt</li>
    <li>Dash of pepper corns</li>
    <li>3 Bay leaves</li>
</ul>


<p><h2><em>Instructions</em></h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Chop all your ingredients. Chicken thighs should be cubed, onions diced or sliced, garlic sliced (crushed is bettter to maximize the garlicy flavor). Divide garlic into 1/2 portions.</li>
    <li>Mix the marinade. In a bowl, mix 1/2 of crushed garlic, vinegar, soy sauce (dark and light), sugar, salt, pepper corns, and bay leaves</li>
    <li>Put chicken thigh parts cut earlier into the marinade and leave for 30 mins to 1 hour</li>
    <li>Heat pan at medium heat </li>
    <li>Saute garlic and onion. In the pan, saute your 2nd half of garlic set aside earlier until translucent. Then, add in your onions until caramelized. </li>
    <li>Pan fry your chicken thighs skin side down. After a few minutes, flip over to color the other side</li>
    <li>Pour in marinade into the pan and simmer for another 30 mins to 1 hour (longer makes it taste better!) or until sauce is reduced to your desired consistency</li>
    <li>Adjust to taste, then serve!</li>
</ol>
